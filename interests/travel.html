	            <h1><strong>Most Visited Country:</strong> Spain</h1>
	            <p>I have visited spain over ten times. It has always been my favourite holiday destination due to the scenery,
	            the beach, the sun and the sea, the list could go on, each adding to the beautiful location. I can vaguely recall
	            my first visit, it was to Marbella. I was about knee-high and remember spending hours in the pool that year as I fell in love with
	            the country despite my young age. I have retrned almost ever year since discovering new locations and cultures visiting 
	            places such as Benalmadena, Malaga, Estepona, San Pedro, Fuengirola and Barcelona. I have also enjoyed holidays to Puerto Ventura
	            and Lanzarote, where I will be going to again this Summer.</p>

	        <div class="section" id="section2">
	            <h1><strong>The Country I want to visit:</strong> United States of America</h1>
	            <p>Despite having travelled to many European countries such as Spain, France, Poland and others, the country I am most
	            exciting about visiting some day is the U.S.A. I adopted a connection with the region after I studied U.S history.
	            There obsession with becoming the Worlds biggest superpower intrigues me and is certainly something I would love to learn more about,
	            by visting the country I'm sure I would gain more significant knowledge than what is in a textbook. Another reason for my desire to
	            visit the States is because of the unique scenery of its spectacular high-rise cities. I wouldn't mind settling their for a few
	            years in adulthood and who knows maybe I could become a recipient of the American Dream.</p>
	        </div>
	        <div class="section" id="section3">
	            <h1><strong>The Country I will settle in:</strong>Ireland</h1>
	            <p>Where else would an Irishman settle? While I do have distant plans of spending a few years of my life in America, there is
	            only one place I could ever settle, when we have this beautiful country of our own why would we go anywhere else. There is something
	            about seeing the outline of the Irish coast when arriving home on a flight that thrills me and makes me feel greatful of where I'm from.
	            No matter where my future endeavours take me, one thing for sure is that I'll always come back home.</p>
