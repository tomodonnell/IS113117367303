	            <h1>What are Cloud Services?</h1>
		            <p>
		                A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet 
		                from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a 
		                company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, 
		                scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed 
		                by a cloud services provider. A cloud service can dynamically scale to meet the 
		                needs of its users, and because the service provider supplies the hardware and 
		                software necessary for the service, there’s no need for a company to provision 
		                or deploy its own resources or allocate IT staff to manage the service.  
		                Examples of cloud services include online data storage and backup solutions, 
		                Web-based e-mail services, hosted office suites and document collaboration services, 
		                database processing, managed technical support services and more.

	            <h1>Why are Cloud Services becoming more popular?</h1>
    	            <p>
    	                <h5>1. Maintains Productivity</h5>
                        Cloud computing allows several people to work on the same document in real time. 
                        People can save a great deal of time spent in updating, filling, and printing documents. 
                        In addition, cloud computing prevents double work and efforts.
    	            </p>
	            <br>
	                <h5>2. Ensures Security</h5>
	                <p>
	                    One gets an impenetrable or closer security by means of cloud computing. 
	                    Data kept locally on a computer can get lost or devastated owing to countless 
	                    reasons. In addition, one cannot backup data on a regular basis, since it seems 
	                    too taxing. Cloud computing solves all these problems by eradicating the necessity 
	                    of data backup.
	                </p>
	           <br>
	               <h5>3. Saves Money</h5>
	               <p>
	                   Organizations receive more for less by means of cloud computing. They can benefit from 
	                   each cloud service by outsourcing computing resources through a third party. This saves 
	                   expenses incurred on cost, maintenance, and time associated with the in-house hosting.
	               </p>
	           <br>
	               <h5>4. Supports Accessibility</h5>
	               <p>
	                   With data stored safely in the cloud, one can access the same just from anywhere across the world. 
	                   This ensures that a person doesn’t require carrying data in USBs and laptops to different places. 
	                   He/she can access any key data simply by utilizing a computer, laptop, tablet or any other device and an Internet connection.
	               </p>

	            <h1>What does the future hold for Cloud Computing?</h1>
	                <p>
	                    With cloud computing and the technology behind it there are many potential opportunities and capabilities. 
	                    Cloud computing can open a whole new world of jobs, services, platforms, applications, and much more. 
	                    There are thousands of possibilities beginning to form as the future of cloud computing starts to really take off.

                        For instance, vendors and service providers can get on board to develop new and different ways of selling their goods 
                        and services to the cloud users through the cloud technology. It opens up a whole new platform for designers and web 
                        developers. Businesses and organizations can organize themselves and conduct business much more affordable and professionally. 
                        Social networking and keeping in touch with friends gets a great deal easier as well.
