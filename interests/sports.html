            <h3><strong>Sports I play:</strong> Hurling and Football</h3>
            <p> I have been playing G.A.A for as long as I can remember. My career began similar to most G.A.A players
            around the country, by going up to the local field in my toddler years. From this early age I fell in love 
            with the sport and as I grew older the culture and history behind it grew on me too. While I had many asperations of becoming
            a Cork hurler or footballer in my early teens, I'm now aware I was never destined to play at that level. However 
            this will not stop me enjoying the sport at amature level as I continue to represent my local club. I also had the 
            privilege of representing St. Colman's College Fermoy in a Harty Cup Semi-Final.</p>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <img alt="Rugby game" src="../pictures/rugby.jpg" width="350" height="150" style="text-align:center"/>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>Favourite sports to watch:</strong> G.A.A and Rugby</h3>
            <p> It's no surprise I am found of watching my native County do battle in the All-Ireland Championships, whether it be hurling or 
            football I'm always glued to the t.v to watch the 'Sunday Game', if not the chances are I'm viewing the match from pitch-side after travelling
            to Croker or Thurles to cheer on the boys in red and soak up the atmosphere.
            <br>
            Yet, I must confess that my favourite sport to watch is not G.A.A, infact its a field game iv never played, Rugby.
            There is something about watching the Irish Rugby Team that makes the hairs on the back of my neck rise, their passion,
            skill and commitment is unique. They put Ireland on the map by representing us at the highest level, often beating the best in the 
            world, which they proved by defeating back to back World Champions New Zealand in Chicago, 2016, in an historic game.

            <h3><strong>Why I love sport:</strong> The emotions it evokes</h3>
            <p>I love sport because more often then not it helps me transend into a better place. When I play sport, or even watch it 
            for that matter I seem to forget about all the stresses of life and just enjoy myself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>Why I believe everybody should play sport:</strong> It is good for our health</h3>
            <p>I understand sport is not for everybody, however I am of the belief that all individuals should partake in some type of sporting activity.
            We do not have to associate sport with professional egos and typical stereotypes along the lines of the 'stuck up' sports star. Sport is more 
            about physical activity and physical and mental well-being. Something as simple as a walk can be classed as a sporting activity, dull it may sound,
            yet the benefits are invaluable. You will lose weight, it will lower your risk of obtaining many diseases and will boost your energy. 
            Surly everybody would be willing to get involved to reep these rewards?
