                <h3>What is SaaS?</h3>
                           
                    <p>
                        Software as a service, or SaaS, is a way of delivering centrally hosted 
                        applications over the Internet as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes 
                        called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, 
                        SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider's servers. Instead of installing and maintaining software, 
                        you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
                        The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. 
                        SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

                <h3>What is PaaS?</h3>
                           
                    <p>
                        Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers 
                        hardware and software tools, usually those needed for application development, to users over the internet. 
                        A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. PaaS frees users 
                        from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. A PaaS provider 
                        builds and supplies a resilient and optimized environment on which users can install applications and data sets. 
                        Users can focus on creating and running applications rather than constructing and maintaining the underlying 
                        infrastructure and services.

                <h3>What is IaaS?</h3>
                           
                    <p>
                        Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for 
                        cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), 
                        and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and 
                        management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT 
                        departments and developers are familiar with today.

                <h3>What is CaaS?</h3>
                        
                    <p>
                        Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased 
                        from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), 
                        instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
                        CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS). CaaS allows businesses to selectively 
                        deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the 
                        large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.
