            <p><strong>Job Title:</strong> Entertainment rep</p>
            <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2012-2017</p>
            <p><strong>Job description:</strong> As my two sibilings and I ran this company, we were required to perform a
            number of challenging tasks. We had to market our business by handing out leaflets and flyers revealing to potential
            customers what services our company offered, such as letting people know of the bouncy castles and marquees we had for hire. 
            We had to take bookings from clients, ensuring no mistakes were made, as an incident such as a double booking would likely
            cause serious problems. We had to deliever and assemle the products, before returning to collect them after the client's events 
            were over. This aspect along with taking bookings forced us to deal with the public in a polite and respectful manner as the 
            comapny's good name along with our own was at stake. We also had to be careful in handling money, we were required to ensure 
            all payments were recieved in full and that the money was carefully lodged into the bank account once recieved. The company discontinued 
            in 2017 as my sibilings and I have decided to persure different careers and are all currently attending Third Level Education.
